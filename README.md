### Java version : 18
### Jdk : Oracle OpenJDK-18.02
### IDE used : IntelliJ

## Assumptions
- Sneaker special ability: We have considered that Sneakers ability to evade fights activates once in a turn. This means irrespective of number of creatures in a room, sneaker's ability decides whether he fights all creatures in the room
- Order of fights: Whenever a creature encounters multiple adventurers in a room or vice versa, the order in which they fight is the order of the arrival of adventurers or creatures
- Multiple termination condition scenario: If treasures found >=10, all adventurers are dead, one of creatures alive, we are considering Adventures win by finding treasures. 
- Orbiter movement: We consider each orbiter instance move in one particular direction clockwise/anticlockwise one room a turn
